      <h3>My passion for coding👩‍💻</h3>

      <p>
        <br />
        I have always been interested in technology and how it can be used to
        solve problems.<br />
        I was first introduced to coding when I was working on a project for my
        previous job as an accountant💻. <br />I was tasked with creating a
        program that would automate some of the financial reporting processes🕵️‍♀️.
        <br />I found the process of coding to be very rewarding and enjoyed the
        challenge of solving problems through code🔀. <br />Since then, I have
        been exploring different coding languages and tools and have been
        working on various coding projects in my free time🧐. <br />I find
        coding to be a great way to express my creativity and enjoy the process
        of building something from scratch🛠️. <br />I am excited to continue
        learning more about coding and am looking forward to applying my skills
        in a professional setting🏅🥉🥈🥇.
