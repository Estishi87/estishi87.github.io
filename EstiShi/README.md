## Hello again! 👋<br > 


#### <p align="left">This web page created by me and inspired from many differents tetorials and web developer sites.<br > </p>
  ## <p align="left">About</p> 

<p align="left">First I desined the main section itself and in the time I added the next sections.
I have showed this web to my friends and everytime I asked for feedback, someone gave me another idea with made me improve this web.
I've got to say that I really benefit the meet-ups and also some of the mentors and coleuges helped me and gave me some more ideas which really helps!

<p align="left">I have styled an infinate moving grid on the top of the webpage to make it stylish, I used the same method to create the game board:<p align="left">
