## Hello again! 👋<br > 
## <p align="left">This web page created by me and inspired from many different tetorials and web development sites.<br > </p>

 
  
###  <p align="left">I created this project to apply for Founders and Coders Software Developer [Skills Bootcamp](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/learn/)<img src="images/FAC.jpg" alt="Logo" width="40" height="40" style="margin-bottom: -7px">.<br > </p>

  ## <p align="center">About</p> 

<p align="left">First I desined the main section itself and in the time I added the next sections.
I have showed this web to my friends and everytime I asked for feedback, someone gave me another idea😅, which made me improve this website.<br />
I've got to say that I really benefit from the FAC meet-ups, some of the mentors and coleuges helped me and gave me some more ideas which really helps!

<p align="left">I have tried to make this web as uniqe as possible and played around with some different functions I have leart on my progress.
