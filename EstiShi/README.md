  ## <p align="left">About</p>

#### <a> <img src="images/FAC.JPG" width="80" height="80">
  </a> <p align="left">I created this project to apply for Founders and Coders Software Developer [Skills Bootcamp](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/learn/)<br > </p>
  ## <p align="left">About</p> 

<p align="left">First I desined the main section itself and in the time I added the next sections.
I have showed this web to my friends and everytime I asked for feedback, someone gave me another idea, which made me improve this web.
I've got to say that I really benefit from the meet-ups and also some of the mentors and coleuges helped me and gave me some more ideas which really helps!

<p align="left">I have tried to make this web as uniqe as possible and played around with some different functions I have leart on my progress.<p align="left">
