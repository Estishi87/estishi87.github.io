Hello 👋
Here there is a list of my coding projects😁.
I'm a a begginer web developer and would like to learn more and I would love to be a great web developer and to get more experiance📈.
I have always been interested in technology and how it can be used to solve problems💫.
I find it really amazing that this written words can automate so many things that can makes our lives easier! 🦾
I was first introduced to coding when I was working on a project for my previous job as an accountant💻.
I was tasked with creating a program that would automate some of the financial reporting processes🕵️‍♀️.
I found the process of coding to be very rewarding and enjoyed the challenge of solving problems through code🔀.
Since then, I have been exploring different coding languages and tools and have been working on various coding projects in my free time🧐.
I find coding to be a great way to express my creativity and enjoy the process of building something from scratch🛠️.
I am excited to continue learning more about coding and am looking forward to applying my skills in a professional setting🏅🥉🥈🥇

Hope you like it! 🙌🏻
