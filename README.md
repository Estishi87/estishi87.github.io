## Hello! 👋<br >
  ### Here are some of my coding projects😁. <br ></div>
#### I’m a beginner web developer and I would like to progress in this area to build up my set of skills and become a great web developer.<br > 
I have always been interested in technology and how it can be used to solve problems💫. Thinking about programming, I find it really amazing that these written words can automate processes and change so many things that can make our lives easier! 🦾<br ><br >
I was first introduced to coding when I was working on a project for my previous job as an accountant💻. I was tasked with creating a program that would automate some of the financial reporting processes🕵️‍♀️. I find the process of coding to be very rewarding and I enjoy the challenge of solving problems through code🔀.<br ><br >
I have been exploring different coding languages and tools and have been working on various coding projects in my free time🧐. I find coding to be a great way to express my creativity and I enjoy the process of developing new applications🛠️.<br ><br >
I am excited to continue learning more about coding and I am looking forward to applying my skills in a professional setting🏅🥉🥈🥇.<br ><br >

Hope you like it! 🙌🏻
