## Hello! 👋<br >
  ### Here there are some of my coding projects😁. <br ></div>
#### I'm a begginer web developer and would like to learn more and would love to be a great web developer in the near future and to get more experiance🤖.<br > 
I have always been interested in technology and how it can be use to solve problems💫.<br >
When I'm diply thinking about it, I find it really amazing that this written words can automate and change so many things that can make our lives easier! 🦾<br >
I was first introduced to coding when I was working on a project for my previous job as an accountant💻.<br >
I was tasked with creating a program that would automate some of the financial reporting processes🕵️‍♀️.<br >
I found the process of coding to be very rewarding and enjoyed the challenge of solving problems through code🔀.<br >
Since then, I have been exploring different coding languages and tools and have been working on various coding projects in my free time🧐.<br >
I find coding to be a great way to express my creativity and enjoy the process of building something from scratch🛠️.<br >
I am excited to continue learning more about coding and am looking forward to applying my skills in a professional setting🏅🥉🥈🥇<br >

Hope you like it! 🙌🏻
